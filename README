Simple Sudoku for S60 based phones.

Platforms:
----------
Python 1.4.x and 1.9.x both supported.

Install:
--------
Just put the source file [pys60_sudoku.py] into your Python directory on the
phone, it can be in the phone memory or on the memory card. Start the Python
console and run the script.

If you want to make a SIS package from it try to use ensymble.

Have fun!
