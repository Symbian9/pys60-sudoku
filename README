Just put the source file [pys60_sudoku.py] into your Python directory on the
phone, it can be in the phone memory or on the memory card. Start the Python
console and run the script. Have fun! If you want to make a SIS from it wait
for my Py2SIS app which will use ensymble for creating the package, but will
have a GUI [probably GTK].

Cheers,
